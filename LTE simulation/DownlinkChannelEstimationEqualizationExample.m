%% Introduction
% This example shows how a simple transmitter-channel-receiver simulation
% may be created using functions from the LTE System Toolbox. The example
% generates a frame worth of data on one antenna port. As no transport
% channel is created in this example the data is random bits, QPSK
% modulated and mapped to every symbol in a subframe. A cell specific
% reference signal and primary and secondary synchronization signals are
% created and mapped to the subframe. 10 subframes are individually
% generated to create a frame. The frame is OFDM modulated, passed through
% an Extended Vehicular A Model (EVA5) fading channel, additive white
% Gaussian noise added and demodulated. MMSE equalization using channel and
% noise estimation is applied and finally the received and equalized
% resource grids are plotted.

%% Cell-Wide Settings
% The cell-wide settings are specified in a structure |enb|. A number of
% the functions used in this example require a subset of the settings
% specified below. In this example only one transmit antenna is used.

enb.NDLRB = 15;                 % Number of resource blocks
enb.CellRefP = 1;               % One transmit antenna port
enb.NCellID = 10;               % Cell ID
enb.CyclicPrefix = 'Normal';    % Normal cyclic prefix
enb.DuplexMode = 'FDD';         % FDD

%% SNR Configuration
% The operating SNR is configured in decibels by the value |SNRdB| which is
% also converted into a linear SNR.

SNRdB = 22;             % Desired SNR in dB
SNR = 10^(SNRdB/20);    % Linear SNR  
rng('default');         % Configure random number generators

%% Channel Model Configuration
% The channel model is configured using a structure. In this example a
% fading channel with an Extended Vehicular A (EVA) delay profile and 120Hz
% Doppler frequency is used. These parameters along with MIMO correlation
% and other channel model specific parameters are set.

cfg.Seed = 1;                  % Random channel seed
cfg.NRxAnts = 1;               % 1 receive antenna
cfg.DelayProfile = 'EVA';      % EVA delay spread
cfg.DopplerFreq = 120;         % 120Hz Doppler frequency
cfg.MIMOCorrelation = 'Low';   % Low (no) MIMO correlation
cfg.InitTime = 0;              % Initialize at time zero
cfg.NTerms = 16;               % Oscillators used in fading model
cfg.ModelType = 'GMEDS';       % Rayleigh fading model type
cfg.InitPhase = 'Random';      % Random initial phases
cfg.NormalizePathGains = 'On'; % Normalize delay profile power 
cfg.NormalizeTxAnts = 'On';    % Normalize for transmit antennas

%% Channel Estimator Configuration
% A user defined window is used to average pilot symbols to reduce the
% effect of noise. The averaging window size is configured in terms of
% resource elements (REs), in time and frequency. A conservative 9-by-9
% window is used in this example as an EVA delay profile and 120Hz Doppler
% frequency cause the channel changes quickly over time and frequency. A
% 9-by-9 window includes the 4 pilots immediately surrounding the pilot of
% interest when averaging. Selecting an averaging window is discussed in
% <matlab:doc('channel-estimation') channel estimation concepts>.

cec.PilotAverage = 'UserDefined'; % Pilot averaging method
cec.FreqWindow = 9;               % Frequency averaging window in REs
cec.TimeWindow = 9;               % Time averaging window in REs

%%
% Interpolation is performed by the channel estimator between pilot
% estimates to create a channel estimate for all REs. To improve the
% estimate multiple subframes can be used when interpolating. An
% interpolation window of 3 subframes with a centered interpolation window
% uses pilot estimates from 3 consecutive subframes to estimate the center
% subframe.

cec.InterpType = 'Cubic';         % Cubic interpolation
cec.InterpWinSize = 3;            % Interpolate up to 3 subframes 
                                  % simultaneously
cec.InterpWindow = 'Centred';     % Interpolation windowing method

%% Subframe Resource Grid Size
% In this example it is useful to have access to the subframe resource grid
% dimensions. These are determined using
% <matlab:doc('lteDLResourceGridSize') lteDLResourceGridSize>. This
% function returns an array containing the number of subcarriers, number of
% OFDM symbols and number of transmit antenna ports in that order.

gridsize = lteDLResourceGridSize(enb);
K = gridsize(1);    % Number of subcarriers
L = gridsize(2);    % Number of OFDM symbols in one subframe
P = gridsize(3);    % Number of transmit antenna ports

%% Transmit Resource Grid
% An empty resource grid |txGrid| is created which will be populated with
% subframes.
txGrid = [];

%% Payload Data Generation
% As no transport channel is used in this example the data sent over the
% channel will be random QPSK modulated symbols. A subframe worth of
% symbols is created so a symbol can be mapped to every resource element.
% Other signals required for transmission and reception will overwrite
% these symbols in the resource grid.

% Number of bits needed is size of resource grid (K*L*P) * number of bits
% per symbol (2 for QPSK)
numberOfBits = K*L*P*2; 

% Create random bit stream
inputBits = randi([0 1], numberOfBits, 1); 

% Modulate input bits
inputSym = lteSymbolModulate(inputBits,'QPSK');	


%% Frame Generation
% The frame will be created by generating individual subframes within a
% loop and appending each created subframe to the previous subframes. The
% collection of appended subframes are contained within |txGrid|. This
% appending is repeated ten times to create a frame. When the OFDM
% modulated time domain waveform is passed through a channel the waveform
% will experience a delay. To avoid any samples being missed due to this
% delay an extra subframe is generated, therefore 11 subframes are
% generated in total. For each subframe the Cell-Specific Reference Signal
% (Cell RS) is added. The Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS) and
% Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS) are also added. Note that these
% synchronization signals only occur in subframes 0 and 5, but the LTE
% System Toolbox takes care of generating empty signals and indices in the
% other subframes so that the calling syntax here can be completely uniform
% across the subframes.

% For all subframes within the frame
for sf = 0:10
    
    % Set subframe number
    enb.NSubframe = mod(sf,10);
    
    % Generate empty subframe
    subframe = lteDLResourceGrid(enb);
    
    % Map input symbols to grid
    subframe(:) = inputSym;

    % Generate synchronizing signals
    pssSym = ltePSS(enb);
    sssSym = lteSSS(enb);
    pssInd = ltePSSIndices(enb);
    sssInd = lteSSSIndices(enb);

    % Map synchronizing signals to the grid
    subframe(pssInd) = pssSym;
    subframe(sssInd) = sssSym;

    % Generate cell specific reference signal symbols and indices
    cellRsSym = lteCellRS(enb);
    cellRsInd = lteCellRSIndices(enb);

    % Map cell specific reference signal to grid
    subframe(cellRsInd) = cellRsSym;
    
    % Append subframe to grid to be transmitted
    txGrid = [txGrid subframe]; %#ok
      
end

%% OFDM Modulation
% In order to transform the frequency domain OFDM symbols into the time
% domain, OFDM modulation is required. This is achieved using
% <matlab:doc('lteOFDMModulate') lteOFDMModulate>. The function returns two
% values; a matrix |txWaveform| and a structure |info| containing the
% sampling rate. |txWaveform| is the resulting time domain waveform. Each
% column contains the time domain signal for each antenna port. In this
% example, as only one antenna port is used, only one column is returned.
% |info.SamplingRate| is the sampling rate at which the time domain
% waveform was created. This value is required by the channel model.

[txWaveform,info] = lteOFDMModulate(enb,txGrid); 
txGrid = txGrid(:,1:140);

%% Fading Channel
% The time domain waveform is passed through the channel model
% (<matlab:doc('lteFadingChannel') lteFadingChannel>) configured by the
% structure |cfg|. The channel model requires the sampling rate of the time
% domain waveform so the parameter |cfg.SamplingRate| is set to the value
% returned by <matlab:doc('lteOFDMModulate') lteOFDMModulate>. The waveform
% generated by the channel model function contains one column per receive
% antenna. In this example one receive antenna is used, therefore the
% returned waveform has one column.

cfg.SamplingRate = info.SamplingRate;

% Pass data through the fading channel model
rxWaveform = lteFadingChannel(cfg,txWaveform);

%% Additive Noise
% The SNR is given by $\mathrm{SNR}=E_s/N_0$ where $E_s$ is the energy of
% the signal of interest and $N_0$ is the noise power. The noise added
% before OFDM demodulation will be amplified by the FFT. Therefore to
% normalize the SNR at the receiver (after OFDM demodulation) the noise
% must be scaled. The amplification is the square root of the size of the
% FFT. The size of the FFT can be determined from the sampling rate of
% the time domain waveform (|info.SamplingRate|) and the subcarrier spacing
% (15 kHz). The power of the noise to be added can be scaled so that $E_s$
% and $N_0$ are normalized after the OFDM demodulation to achieve the
% desired SNR (|SNRdB|).

% Calculate noise gain
N0 = 1/(sqrt(2.0*enb.CellRefP*double(info.Nfft))*SNR);

% Create additive white Gaussian noise
noise = N0*complex(randn(size(rxWaveform)),randn(size(rxWaveform)));   

% Add noise to the received time domain waveform
rxWaveform = rxWaveform + noise;

%% Synchronization
% The offset caused by the channel in the received time domain signal is
% obtained using <matlab:doc('lteDLFrameOffset') lteDLFrameOffset>. This
% function returns a value |offset| which indicates how many samples the
% waveform has been delayed. The offset is considered identical for
% waveforms received on all antennas. The received time domain waveform can
% then be manipulated to remove the delay using |offset|.

offset = lteDLFrameOffset(enb,rxWaveform);
rxWaveform = rxWaveform(1+offset:end,:);

%% OFDM Demodulation
% The time domain waveform undergoes OFDM demodulation to transform it to
% the frequency domain and recreate a resource grid. This is accomplished
% using <matlab:doc('lteOFDMDemodulate') lteOFDMDemodulate>. The resulting
% grid is a 3-dimensional matrix. The number of rows represents the number
% of subcarriers. The number of columns equals the number of OFDM symbols
% in a subframe. The number of subcarriers and symbols is the same for the
% returned grid from OFDM demodulation as the grid passed into
% <matlab:doc('lteOFDMModulate') lteOFDMModulate>. The number of planes
% (3rd dimension) in the grid corresponds to the number of receive
% antennas.

rxGrid = lteOFDMDemodulate(enb,rxWaveform);

%% Channel Estimation
% To create an estimation of the channel over the duration of the
% transmitted resource grid <matlab:doc('lteDLChannelEstimate')
% lteDLChannelEstimate> is used. The channel estimation function is
% configured by the structure |cec|. <matlab:doc('lteDLChannelEstimate')
% lteDLChannelEstimate> assumes the first subframe within the resource grid
% is subframe number |enb.NSubframe| and therefore the subframe number must
% be set prior to calling the function. In this example the whole received
% frame will be estimated in one call and the first subframe within the
% frame is subframe number 0. The function returns a 4-D array of complex
% weights which the channel applies to each resource element in the
% transmitted grid for each possible transmit and receive antenna
% combination. The possible combinations are based upon the eNodeB
% configuration |enb| and the number of receive antennas (determined by the
% size of the received resource grid). The 1st dimension is the subcarrier,
% the 2nd dimension is the OFDM symbol, the 3rd dimension is the receive
% antenna and the 4th dimension is the transmit antenna. In this example
% one transmit and one receive antenna is used therefore the size of
% |estChannel| is 180-by-140-by-1-by-1.

enb.NSubframe = 0;
[estChannel, noiseEst] = lteDLChannelEstimate(enb,cec,rxGrid);

%% MMSE Equalization
% The effects of the channel on the received resource grid are equalized
% using <matlab:doc('lteEqualizeMMSE') lteEqualizeMMSE>. This function uses
% the estimate of the channel |estChannel| and noise |noiseEst| to equalize
% the received resource grid |rxGrid|. The function returns |eqGrid| which
% is the equalized grid. The dimensions of the equalized grid are the same
% as the original transmitted grid (|txGrid|) before OFDM modulation.

eqGrid = lteEqualizeMMSE(rxGrid, estChannel, noiseEst);

%% Analysis
% The received resource grid is compared with the equalized resource grid.
% The error between the transmitted and equalized grid and transmitted and
% received grids are calculated. This creates two matrices (the same size
% as the resource arrays) which contain the error for each symbol. To allow
% easy inspection the received and equalized grids are plotted on a
% logarithmic scale using <matlab:doc('surf') surf> within
% <matlab:edit('hDownlinkEstimationEqualizationResults.m')
% hDownlinkEstimationEqualizationResults.m>. These diagrams show that
% performing channel equalization drastically reduces the error in the
% received resource grid.

% Calculate error between transmitted and equalized grid
eqError = txGrid - eqGrid;
rxError = txGrid - rxGrid;

% Compute EVM across all input values
% EVM of pre-equalized receive signal
EVM = comm.EVM;
EVM.AveragingDimensions = [1 2];
preEqualisedEVM = step(EVM,txGrid,rxGrid);
fprintf('Percentage RMS EVM of Pre-Equalized signal: %0.3f%%\n', ...
        preEqualisedEVM); 
% EVM of post-equalized receive signal
postEqualisedEVM = step(EVM,txGrid,eqGrid);
fprintf('Percentage RMS EVM of Post-Equalized signal: %0.3f%%\n', ...
        postEqualisedEVM); 

% Plot the received and equalized resource grids 
hDownlinkEstimationEqualizationResults(rxGrid, eqGrid);
